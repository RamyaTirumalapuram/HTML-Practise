	<h2>Hard Work and Laziness</h2>
	<p>In a large house, lived a lazy Young Man. He woke up in the afternoon, ate his meals and then lay in bed again. He had a parrot named Polly. She watched this lazy fellow and was puzzled by him. One day, Polly asked the Young Man, “Don’t you get tired of lying in bed all day and all night? The sun has been out hours ago, and people have finished half their day’s work.” “Why are you so lazy?” she asked, as she ruffled her feathers. The Young Man yawned and answered, “Every morning, when I wake up, two friends whisper in my ears. One friend is Hard Work and the other Laziness.” “Hard Work says, Wake up! There is lots to do today. Time is passing by, don’t waste it by sleeping.’ But Laziness says, Why the hurry to wake up? Sleep some more. Why should you work while there are others to work hard?”‘ The Young Man continued, “I listen patiently to both my friends. All my time goes by like that and so, I keep lying in bed for a long time.<br>
	<b>Moral:</b>” Just talk does not help; we should get up and work."</p>

It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him. He created the feeling of unhappiness in others. But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour: “An Old Man is happy today, he doesn’t complain about anything, smiles, and even his face is freshened up.” The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked: Villager: What happened to you? “Nothing special. Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness, and it was useless.
